### `messages`

## strengths

- uses web sockets which allows for realtime chatting.
- css formated to work on mobile devices and desktop


## limitations

- render can be extremely slow.
- satisfys basic chatroom functionality.
- still very minimal viable product for a basic chatroom.
- With these sockets I wanna make it so it goes into db automatically and doesnâ€™t refresh page to update form to send.
- internal database error if search isnt a valid email

## extensions 

- groupchats.
- adding friends.
- sending more than just raw text.
